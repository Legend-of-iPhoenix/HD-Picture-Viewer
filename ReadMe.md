High Definition Picture View for the TI-84 Plus CE

By: TheLastMillennial



Send "HDPic.8xp" and any example image(s) you'd like to see to your calculator.

Using ICE, compile the program and execute it. 

The program currently only displays a thumbnail image, pauses, then quits.

No custom images yet. My PC code is acting funny and I don't want to upload it quite yet.

Programs:

ICE- http://cemete.ch/DL1481


Changelog:
