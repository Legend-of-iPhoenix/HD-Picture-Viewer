I'm learning how to use github so please pardon this horrible readme.
Send all .8xp and .8xv file to your calculator.
Compile the HDPic program using ICE.
It will detect the app var you sent and show a thumbnail image of it.

Better ReadMe and more code coming probably soon! (But who knows, maybe it'll be years before I look at this again)
